class Solution {

    void printGfg(int N) {
        // code here
        if(N>1)
          printGfg(N-1);
        System.out.print("GFG"+" ");
          
    }
}

//////
Example:

Input:
5
Output:
GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printGfg() that takes N as parameter and prints N times GFG recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).
